            <h2>SHERLOCK 2.0</h2>
            <p>
              OWASP Student Chapter, PCCOE conducted an event called SHERLOCK
              2.0 under ANANTYA which was a sequel to our previous event
              SHERLOCK. The plot included Pimpri Chinchwad College of
              Engineering facing a severe cyber threat as hackers take control
              of all campus systems, displaying an anonymous video message. The
              hacker's message, "Got you surrounded! Así que rómpelo," signified
              their control. Despite efforts by the OWASP student Chapter, the
              hacker remained elusive. To combat this, they launch Operation
              SHERLOCK 2.0, seeking a skilled detective to unravel the hacker's
              identity and restore control. This event was conducted in 3
              rounds.
